# Area-Volume-capacity-curves-using-ArcPY
A python code that calculates the Area and Volume capacity curves behind a Dam using DEM and Dam shapefile

## The code Aims to solve the following problem:

You are required in this problem to develop a GIS tool to automatically calculate
the volume and area capacity curves of any reservoir (considering that the user
of your tool may not be a GIS professional). You should test your tool on the
test dataset given in problem no.2 (the GERD reservoir). The test dataset is also given again in our course which
is a shapefile of the location of the two dams (i.e., the main and saddle dams).
Please approach your problem as follows:

- Start writing your python script and debug your code and
then copying to ArcGIS python console. Keep trying until you finalize your
code and be sure that it is fully functioning.
- Create an ArcTool and attach your script to it by modifying the script to
obtain its input as tool parameters.

## The main concept is using ArcPY packages to calculate the volume and area capacity curves and to creat an ArcGIS tool
